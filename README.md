# Datadome Geetest Captcha Solver
This solver is exclusively meant for educational purposes. The software in this respository contains no information on my other projects as this repository merely just compliments. 

This geetest solver is used to automatically solve the anti-bot measures instilled by some sites like Footsites and more. 

Also, please keep in mind, this was initially frontend based, then transformed to a backend serverside ecosystem. This was recently switched back to a frontend application, so keep in mind, there will be some glaring bugs and/or issues. 

This is experimental.

### Purpose and use of a Geetest automated captcha solver. 
Of course, there are obvious use cases. Notably to solve captchas automatically. But keep in mind this is yours to explore and reflect on! 

### Installation 
If you look at the index.js file, you can see that I left comments on where to edit for implementation of some sort into your software. You must port in your captcha urls, proper cids, proxy managing systems, solver systems, and more to implement properly. Unfortuantetly, I have learned these factors differ per application, forcing me to completely let the user edit and conform the code to fit. 

### Compliments Where Compliments Are Due. 
I honestly do not know where the initial code has came from. Found the skeleton of the code in my projects folder due to me working on geetest a few months ago and have not really cited any specifics. If you did create a portion of this code, please dm me on twitter and I will credit you. 

### Other Things to Acknowledge 
This is not a substitute for a captcha solver. Not even in the slightest. It is a way to reflect upon how to construct a geetest captcha autosolving solution, taking advantage of where I can.
